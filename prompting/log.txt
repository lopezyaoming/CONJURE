Today's session focused on implementing a comprehensive gesture-based control system and improving the overall user experience.

Advances:
1.  **Gesture Lexicon Implementation**: A full set of hand gestures has been integrated to control the main modeling functions. The system now recognizes touches between the thumb and other fingers on both hands.

2.  **Right-Hand Commands**:
    *   **Deformation (Thumb + Index)**: Activates mesh deformation. This is now weighted to only be influenced by the thumb and index fingertips for more precise control.
    *   **Camera Orbit (Thumb + Middle/Ring)**: The camera now orbits around the central mesh on the Z-axis (middle finger) or Y-axis (ring finger), providing a more intuitive inspection experience. This replaces the previous object-centric rotation.
    *   **Cube Creation (Thumb + Pinky)**: Allows the user to dynamically create a cube primitive. The cube is finalized and merged with the main mesh upon gesture release.

3.  **Left-Hand Commands**:
    *   **Camera Reset (Thumb + Index)**: A new "home" button functionality. Holding this gesture for one second resets the camera to its initial position, preventing disorientation.

4.  **User Experience Enhancements**:
    *   **Flicker Correction**: Eliminated the flickering of fingertip markers by moving them to a distant location instead of toggling their visibility.
    *   **Gesture Hold Mechanism**: Implemented a one-second hold requirement for the camera reset gesture to prevent accidental activation.
    *   **Blender UI Panel**: Added a dedicated "CONJURE" panel in the Blender UI to cleanly initiate and finalize the script, removing the need to manually stop it.
    *   **Coordinate Mapping Scale**: Introduced configurable scaling factors (X, Y, Z) for hand mapping, allowing for fine-tuning of gesture sensitivity.

5.  **Code & Stability**:
    *   Refactored Blender script to correctly register and handle custom properties, resolving `AttributeError` tracebacks.
    *   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `mediapipe` library by adjusting import statements for better environment compatibility.
