Sculptural anatomy: elongated cranium, subtle asymmetry, three delicate forehead crests, faint bioluminescent veins beneath smooth matte skin, small ventral mandibles, large reflective almond eyes with glossy corneal highlights. Directly generated organic high-resolution mesh with fine pores and soft subsurface scattering, shallow depth of field, 50mm lens, f/5.6, high-definition, crisp detail, minimalist product-photography composition.",
