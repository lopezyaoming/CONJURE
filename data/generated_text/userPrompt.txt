Create an abstract composition featuring a smooth, rounded central form with scattered spherical elements. The central form should evoke a sense of fluidity and organic movement, while the spheres add a playful, dynamic contrast. Use a soft, muted color palette to enhance the serene and harmonious feel of the scene.
