Test script for the new segment selection system in CONJURE Phase 1.

This script verifies:
1. Placeholder "Mesh" creation during import
2. Segment selection mode activation
3. Material setup and switching
4. State management for deform/selection mode conflicts
5. Exit selection mode functionality

Run this script from the CONJURE root directory.
