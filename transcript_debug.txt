=== CONJURE TRANSCRIPT DEBUG LOG WITH WHISPER ===
[10:56:23] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Welcome to Conjure, what do you want to create today?
[10:56:34] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: That sounds like a fun project.
[10:56:35] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you leaning towards something modern and minimalist or perhaps more classic and ornate?
[10:56:35] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: To get started, what style of chair are you envisioning?
[10:56:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Think dramatic curves, rich details, and a sense of grandeur.
[10:56:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Baroque! I love it!
[10:56:49] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Now tell me, are there any specific features or materials that come to mind for this Baroque chair? Perhaps intricate carvings, plush velvet upholstery, or maybe gilded accents.
[10:57:09] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Wonderful.
[10:57:10] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: So we're picturing a chair with all the Baroque hallmarks, elaborate carvings, luxurious velvet, and touches of gold.
[10:57:11] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: To really capture that opulent feel, what kind of mood or atmosphere do you want this chair to evoke? Should it feel grand and formal, or perhaps a bit more intimate and cozy despite its ornate nature?
[10:57:32] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: That's an interesting twist, a Baroque chair that feels intimate and cozy.
[10:57:32] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: We can definitely achieve that.
[10:57:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Perhaps we can focus on the plushness of the velvet and the warmth of the wood, while still keeping those beautiful, ornate details.
[10:57:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: What do you think about a deep, rich color for the velvet, like a burgundy or a forest green, to enhance that cozy feeling?
[10:57:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you still there?
[10:57:59] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Let me know if you need a moment to think about the colors or anything else.
[10:58:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great.
[10:58:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: So we've got a Baroque chair in mind with intricate carvings, plush velvet, and gilded accents aiming for an intimate and cozy feel.
[10:58:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: How about we explore the shape a bit more?
[10:58:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Should the chair have a high back for a sense of regal enclosure or perhaps a slightly lower, more open design to encourage a feeling of relaxed conversation?
USER (Whisper): you
[10:58:30] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: you
[10:58:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Can you tell me more about it?
[10:58:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: What do you like or dislike about its presence, and how do you see it fitting with the Baroque style we've discussed?
[10:58:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: It sounds like you're noticing a box in the design.
