[18:48:45] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Welcome to Conjure, what do you want to create today?
[18:48:55] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: That sounds like an interesting idea.
[18:48:55] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like to start with a primitive shape to roughly describe your beacon shield, or would you prefer to verbally describe it in more detail?
USER (Whisper): Hey, I wanna create a baking shield.
[18:48:56] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Hey, I wanna create a baking shield.
[18:49:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great!
[18:49:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Let's dive into the details then.
USER (Whisper): Uh, no, I'm just gonna describe it to you.
[18:49:08] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Uh, no, I'm just gonna describe it to you.
[18:49:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: about its shape, form, and
[18:49:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: and overall characteristics.
[18:49:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: you envision it being made of, and...
[18:49:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: What kind of material do you use?

[18:49:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are there any specific design elements that come to mind?
[18:49:08] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Beaconshield, could you tell me a bit more about...
[18:49:19] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please go on.
[18:49:21] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: What kind of shape do you envision for your beacon shield?
[18:50:19] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: That's a fantastic and very detailed vision for your beacon shield.
USER (Whisper): Yeah, let's make it a round shield. Let's make it either steel or rock or some very petrous material. And it needs to be a monolithic material. That means it has only one material and it's surrounded by very fine details of almost Baroque-like detailing or fine, very detailed tapestry or bas-relief. It has the tapestry and the bas-relief, it kind of has dragon scenes and battle scenes with knights and kings and stuff. And remember, the shield should always be floating on a white background.
