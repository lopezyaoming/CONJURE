=== CONJURE TRANSCRIPT DEBUG LOG WITH WHISPER ===
[02:19:21] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Welcome to Conjure, what do you want to create today?
[02:19:29] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great choice.
[02:19:29] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like me to create the cube now?
[02:19:29] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I can spawn a cube to block out your idea.
[02:19:37] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Perfect
[02:19:38] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: He's spawning a cube now.
[02:19:38] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you're done blocking out, say I'm done, and I'll move us to the next step.
[02:19:38] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please give it a moment to appear, then use your hands to rough in the main proportions.
[02:19:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: On it!
[02:19:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'll place a cube in the scene now.
[02:19:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Take a moment to push and pull it to match your rough silhouette.
[02:19:55] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you're satisfied, just say I'm done, and we'll move on to describing details for generation.
[02:20:12] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'm here.
[02:20:12] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Your cube should be in the scene ready for you.
[02:20:13] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Do you want a quick nudge on proportions before you sculpt, or are you good to block it out and tell me when you're done?
[02:20:14] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: If you prefer guidance, tell me the object you're aiming for, so I can suggest rough dimensions and tweaks.
