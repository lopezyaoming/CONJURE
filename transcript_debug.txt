[11:25:45] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Hey, uh, I want to create a-
[11:25:46] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: What kind of alien head are you imagining? Sleek and elegant or gnarly and textured?
[11:25:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Think about skull shape, eye size and count, mouth or mandibles, and overall vibe.
[11:25:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like me to start you with a simple primitive to roughen the shape, or would you prefer to verbally describe it and I generate it directly?
USER (Whisper): So just generate the head, and I don't want to create the body.
[11:26:14] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: So just generate the head, and I don't want to create the body.

[11:26:18] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Describe your alien head and I'll turn it into a clear generative brief.
[11:26:19] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Eyes, how many, size, placement, glow, or no glow.
[11:26:19] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Mouth, slit, fanged, mandibles, beak, or none?

[11:26:20] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Color and finish, matte, glossy, translucent, pearlescent, or metallic accents.
[11:26:21] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Once I have this, I'll say, back end, let's generate the initial mesh.
[11:26:21] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Style and vibe. Elegant, menacing, ancient, biotech, aquatic, insectoid, or ethereal?
[11:26:21] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please share as much as you like in one go.
[11:26:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Got it!
USER (Whisper): What's up? What is?
[11:26:50] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: What's up? What is?
[11:26:57] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Got it.
[11:26:57] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'll craft a strong first pass.
[11:26:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: subtle rear crest.
[11:26:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Find Inner Glow. Find Vallejo.
[11:26:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Three large almond eyes set in a tree.
[11:26:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Here's the concept I'll generate.
[11:26:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: SLEEK ELONGATED

[11:26:59] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Triangular layout with a faint
[11:27:00] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Back end, let's generate the initial mesh.
[11:27:00] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please hold a moment while it processes.
[11:27:00] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: with hidden needle teeth, smooth semi-translucent skin with gentle ribbing and bony subsurface ridges, faint bioluminescent lines that trace the skull, overall elegant and slightly unsettling.
[11:27:36] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Thanks for waiting.
[11:27:37] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Do you want to use the whole mesh as is, or would you like to select a specific segment to work on?
[11:27:37] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: The initial mesh is in.
[11:27:41] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I can either fuse everything into one piece or enter segment selection so you can pick parts.
[11:27:57] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you still with me?
[11:27:58] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like me to fuse the mesh into one piece or switch to segment selection so you can pick parts to focus on?
