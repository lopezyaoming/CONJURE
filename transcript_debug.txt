[19:55:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: for the Conjure Modeling System.
[19:55:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: conversational AI assistant.
[19:55:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: through the creation cycle.
[19:55:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'm here to guide you through.
[19:55:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Hello there!
USER (Whisper): K, we did it.
[19:55:53] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: K, we did it.
[19:55:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'm Vibe, your special...
[19:55:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: You mentioned wanting to create a cylinder.
[19:55:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like to start with a cylinder to roughly describe your idea? Or would you prefer to verbally describe it first and create something completely new?
[19:56:09] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great.
[19:56:10] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: So, you'd like to use a cylinder as a starting point. That sounds like a good plan. Back end agent, let's prepare to spawn a cylinder.
[19:56:10] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Is a simple cylinder what you had in mind, or were you thinking of something a bit different?
[19:56:16] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Perfect.
[19:56:17] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Now that we're starting with a cylinder, do you have a specific vision for what you want to create with it?
[19:56:17] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you thinking of something like a vase, a pillar, or perhaps something more abstract?
[19:56:17] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Give me a sense of the direction you'd like to take it, and I'll have Backend Agent create the cylinder for you.
[19:56:38] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you still there?
[19:56:39] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please let me know if you'd like to proceed or if you need a moment.
USER (Whisper): Uh, yeah, let's create a cylinder. I don't see any cylinders.
[19:56:47] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Uh, yeah, let's create a cylinder. I don't see any cylinders.
[19:56:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Back-end agent lets trigger spawn primitive with the type set to cylinder.
[19:57:02] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you still there?
