[16:16:32] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Cool, I guess I'm done with the loom there, should I describe to you what I'm trying to do with it?
[16:16:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: We can refine the shape, form, and overall characteristics of your idea. What comes to mind?
USER (Whisper): Yeah, I'm trying to generate a Corinthian column, so what I'm trying to draw here is a basic shape that will eventually become a capital and a bay, and in general a Corinthian column, so in general marble, I guess marble material, quite bad, not very skinny.

[16:17:22] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: could you tell me a bit more about the capital and base? Are you envisioning the classic acanthus leaves on the capital or something more unique?
