=== CONJURE TRANSCRIPT DEBUG LOG WITH WHISPER ===
[17:53:40] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Welcome to Conjure, what do you want to create today?
[17:53:46] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: That sounds like a great idea!
[17:53:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like to start with a primitive shape to roughly describe your table, or would you prefer to verbally describe it in more detail?
USER (Whisper): I want to create a table.
[17:53:47] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: I want to create a table.
USER (Whisper): Yeah, let's serve her to school.

[17:53:59] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Isn't one of the available
[17:53:59] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I can definitely help you start with a primitive.
[17:53:59] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: is. While Cirque
[17:54:00] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: primitive shapes, we have disc, which is a flat circular shape, or perhaps a cylinder, if you're thinking of something with some height.
[17:54:01] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Which of those sounds closer to what you have in mind for your table?
[17:54:14] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Could you please clarify?
USER (Whisper): Cylinders
[17:54:16] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Cylinders
[17:54:17] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you thinking of a flat, circular disk for the tabletop, or a cylinder, which has some height, perhaps like a table leg or a thicker tabletop?
[17:54:18] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Excellent, a cylinder is a great starting point for a table.
USER (Whisper): Cool, I'm gonna start modeling and I'll let you know.
[17:54:30] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Cool, I'm gonna start modeling and I'll let you know.
USER (Whisper): Okay, I'm happy with modeling
[17:54:55] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Okay, I'm happy with modeling
[17:54:56] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great, now that you're happy with the modeling, let's refine the idea.
[17:54:57] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Can you tell me more about the shape, form, and finish you envision for your table?
USER (Whisper): yeah let's create a Saha that you kind of table so I want it to be very sculptural very interesting very flowy like Saha you know
[17:55:21] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: yeah let's create a Saha that you kind of table so I want it to be very sculptural very interesting very flowy like Saha you know
[17:55:22] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Could you tell me a bit more about what's...
[17:55:22] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: an interesting essence.

[17:55:22] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: to capture that sculptural flow.
[17:55:23] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: specific elements of Sahadeh.
[17:55:23] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: style you'd like to see in your table. For example, are you thinking of organic curves, intricate details, or a sense of movement? And what kind of finish or material comes to mind for this piece?
