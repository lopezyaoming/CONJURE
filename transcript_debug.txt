=== CONJURE TRANSCRIPT DEBUG LOG WITH WHISPER ===
[01:37:44] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Welcome to Conjure, what do you want to create today?
USER (Whisper): Hey, uh, let's start with this whole box.
[01:37:52] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Hey, uh, let's start with this whole box.
[01:37:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great.
[01:37:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: starting primitive, or did you have a
[01:37:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Like a tall rectangle.
[01:37:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like me to spawn a cube as your st-
[01:37:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: a different box-like shape in mind.
[01:37:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: a rectangular block or a flatter slab.
[01:37:54] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: If cube works, I can place it now, and you can rough in proportions with your hands.
[01:38:05] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Perfect
[01:38:06] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Back end, please spawn a cube.
[01:38:06] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'll place a cube to get you started.
USER (Whisper): No, yeah, I think you'll be fine.
[01:38:06] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: No, yeah, I think you'll be fine.
[01:38:06] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you're done, say, I'm done, and we'll move on to describing the final idea so I can generate the initial mesh.
[01:38:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Take a moment to block out the proportions with your gestures.
USER (Whisper): Uh, I want to create, uh, a Hungarian-style build with a lot of, like, passage, so I want it to be, like, very, very fluid.
[01:38:30] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Uh, I want to create, uh, a Hungarian-style build with a lot of, like, passage, so I want it to be, like, very, very fluid.
USER (Whisper): Like, very, very bluey, with an almond-like sauce, very low-carb.
[01:38:46] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Like, very, very bluey, with an almond-like sauce, very low-carb.
[01:38:46] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'm with you, fluid, Gary-esque, massing with faceted sweeps and a molten metal skin.
[01:38:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: too.
[01:38:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: scale and purpose, pavilion, mid-rise museum, or high-rise tower.
[01:38:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Overall silhouette, twisting ribbon, stacked and skewed volumes, or a single flowing monolith with carved voids.
[01:38:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: facade character, mirror polished liquid metal, brushed titanium-like panels, or a mixed patchwork of smooth and sharply faceted plates?
[01:38:49] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Before we generate, a few quick dials so Flux knows the vibe. One.
[01:38:49] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: If you're ready, I can synthesize this into a prompt and generate the initial mesh.
[01:38:49] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Just say the word and I'll trigger it.
USER (Whisper): It's awesome.
[01:38:57] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: It's awesome.
USER (Whisper): Fascinating.
[01:39:18] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Fascinating.
USER (Whisper): Okay, okay, like, uh, um, first of all, second of all, oh, can you repeat this question? So, by the way, CLT-
[01:39:35] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Okay, okay, like, uh, um, first of all, second of all, oh, can you repeat this question? So, by the way, CLT-
[01:39:38] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Got it. Museum scale.
[01:39:38] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: The second question was about the overall silhouette.
[01:39:39] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like a twisting ribbon form, stacked in skewed volumes, or a single flowing monolith with carved voids?
[01:39:40] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Once you choose, I'll fold it into the prompt and get the first mesh generating.
USER (Whisper): Single, single, monolith, but I don't want to do the edge, edge monolith, and uh, let's go with mold metal, like, as shine as possible.
[01:40:05] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Single, single, monolith, but I don't want to do the edge, edge monolith, and uh, let's go with mold metal, like, as shine as possible.
[01:40:05] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Excellent
[01:40:06] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Museum-scale, single-flowing monolith, ultra-shiny, molten-metal façade.
[01:40:06] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: If that sounds good, I can generate the initial mesh now.
[01:40:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Any preference on mood and proportion before we generate, tall and slender, low and sprawling, or mid-height with dramatic overhangs and carved voids?
[01:40:07] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Just say generate it and I'll kick it off, then we'll choose whole or parts next.
[01:40:30] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great.
USER (Whisper): Okay, now let's just generate a mesh.
[01:40:31] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Okay, now let's just generate a mesh.
[01:40:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please hold a moment while I generate the initial mesh.
[01:40:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: fluid massing with subtle
[01:40:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: with ultra-shiny molten.
[01:40:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Back end, let's generate the initial.
[01:40:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: mesh with this prompt.
[01:40:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Mid-height with carbon fiber.
[01:40:32] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Museum Scale Single Flowing Monolith
[01:40:32] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: metal facade, Gary-inspired.
[01:40:32] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: voids and dramatic overhangs. Neutral studio lighting, clean presentation.
USER (Whisper): Okay, uh, it has spawned. I want to, uh, select a sec.
[01:42:14] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Okay, uh, it has spawned. I want to, uh, select a sec.
[01:42:17] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Perfect timing.
[01:42:17] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Do you want me to enter segment selection mode so you can point to the part you want?
[01:42:18] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I'll switch to selection now, and you can gesture to highlight the segment, then say lock it when you have the one you want.
[01:42:24] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Point to the segment you want and hold for a beat to lock it in.
[01:42:25] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you've got it selected, say ready and I'll load it for refinement.
[01:42:25] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great, entering segment selection mode now.
[01:42:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Selection mode is active.
[01:42:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Point at the segment you want, hold your gaze for a beat, then pinch to confirm.
[01:42:34] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you've got it, say ready and I'll load that segment as the working mesh and center it for sculpting.
[01:42:36] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: If you change your mind, say switch segment and we can pick another.
