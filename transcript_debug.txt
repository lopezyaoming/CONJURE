=== CONJURE TRANSCRIPT DEBUG LOG WITH WHISPER ===
[15:40:11] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Welcome to Conjure, what do you want to create today?
USER (Whisper): What are you doing?
[15:40:16] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: What are you doing?
[15:40:21] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I did not catch that.
[15:40:23] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Tell me what you want to create, and whether you want to start with a simple, primitive shape, or describe it verbally.
[15:40:25] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Are you still there?
[15:40:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Great.
[15:40:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: A cube is a solid start for blocking proportions.
[15:40:35] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Would you like me to spawn a cube now, centered and scaled to a comfortable one meter unit for sculpting, or do you prefer a different size?
[15:40:36] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Once it appears, go ahead and roughen your form with gestures and tell me when you are done.
[15:40:44] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Backend, please spawn a cube primitive centered at origin. Scale to a comfortable one meter unit for sculpting.
[15:40:44] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Cube coming in.
[15:40:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Perfect.
[15:40:47] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I will spawn a cube centered at origin, scaled for comfortable sculpting.
[15:40:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you're done with your rough blockout, say I am done and we will move to the next step.
[15:40:48] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Please wait a moment while it appears, then you can start shaping.
[15:41:03] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: You are welcome.
[15:41:03] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: The cube is in place at the origin, sized for easy sculpting.
[15:41:03] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Take your time shaping it with your gestures.
[15:41:04] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you are done with the rough block out, just say, I am done, and we will move on to describing the final piece for generation.
USER (Whisper): Yeah. Okay.
[15:41:37] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: Yeah. Okay.
[15:41:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Nice.
[15:41:52] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: Take your time to finish the block out.
[15:41:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: As you wrap up, start thinking about the final intent. What is this object, its overall style, and any key features?
[15:41:53] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you are done, say I am done, and I will guide you through a quick description so we can generate the first mesh pass.
USER (Whisper): I'm not here to like...
[15:42:24] [USER_TURN] MESSAGE: I'm not here to like...
[15:42:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: All good.
[15:42:31] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: I am here to make this easy and keep you moving.
[15:42:33] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: When you are ready, just say, I am done, and I will ask a few quick focused questions to generate your first mesh pass.
[15:42:34] [AGENT_TURN] MESSAGE: If you're still shaping, I will wait.
