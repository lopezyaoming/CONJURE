‚úÖ FEATURE:

You must use hugginface‚Äôs API service for PartPacker and FLUX1[dev]/FLUX1.DEPTH. API docs will be provided. everytime FLUX1.DEPTH is called, please render GestureCamera and use GestureRender for t he FLUX1.DEPTH input. on the meantime, ignore the agent responsibilities and focus exclusively on the backend python/blender logic. 
PHASE 1: Mesh Selection for VIBE Modeling

Enable users to initialize their 3D model either by:

Spawning a primitive based on conversation,

Or jumping straight into AI-assisted mesh generation via Flux prompt.

Once generated, meshes are filtered, segmented, and either fused into a single object or selected interactively by the user using index/thumb gestures.

PHASE 1 MESH SELECTION:

STEP 1. PRIMITIVE DECISION
A simple chatbox appears in the middle of the screen. 
Agent greets the user, asks the user what it wants. ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do today? Perhaps you want a primitive shape to roughly describe the form and proportion?‚Äù The user can choose to start with a primitive or skip straight to mesh production. [OPTIONAL STEP] If the user wishes to spawn a primitive, the agent must inform the user the multiple primitives they can choose from. As the user gesture-models, the agent asks questions to get a good flux prompt. If the user wishes no primitive to be spawned, the agent just asks the questions while the user answers. When the user is done, it informs the agent, who sends it to the next phase.



AGENT OBJECTIVES:
CONVERSATIONAL AGENT: Resolve the question: What do you want to create? Have a clear view of the object that must be created, complying with enough detail. Determine if the user wants to shape a rough primitive or not. Do you wish to spawn a primitive or simply describe what you have in mind?
BACKEND AGENT: 
If the user asks for a primitive, spawn it as Mesh. Listen for flux prompts and write them down. When the user complies with enough detail, sends userPrompt.txt as prompt input. When the user indicates they are ready, it activates FLUX1.DEPTH, then it goes straight to 3D API PartPacker. The model is spawned on the scene as Mesh. 

STEP 2. SPAWN THE MESH:
OBJECTIVE
Spawn the resultant meshes from the 3D API PartPacker at 0,0,0. This step is very important and requires several moving parts to be working well. A variable for culling and deleting smaller meshes is very necessary: PartPacker generates good large meshes, but it usually get‚Äôs a lot of very small floating meshes that must be culled and deleted, otherwise the segmentation approach makes no sense. the goal: Have only the largest meshes, culling most of the smaller ones makes good sense. Volume will be used as a measure of size. The minimum volume before cull will be a variable available for debugging. The resultant meshes must be labelled in order of volume as seg_1, seg_2, seg_3, etc.

AGENT OBJECTIVES:
CONVERSATIONAL AGENT: Ask the user if they want to use the whole mesh or want to use a segment of it.
BACKEND AGENT: 
Import the mesh using mesh_import. If the user decides to use the whole mesh, call fuse_mesh, and if it decides to segment it, call segment_selection.

STEP 3A. [FUSE MESH]
OBJECTIVE: 
If the user decides to fuse the mesh, fuse_mesh get‚Äôs called. all the segments get boolean union with eachother, from largest to second largest, until all segments are joined. then, the resultant segment (Which now represents all fused segments) gets turned into Mesh, Centroid to 0,0,0, Geometry to Centroid. 

STEP 3B [SELECT SEGMENT]
If the user decides to pick a segment, segment_selection is activated: this is a special mode that helps the user with the mesh selection. It works as following: segments have default_material, but selected segment gets selected_material from blender scene: the way to select the segment is by determining which segment is right hand index finger touching. when the user is happy with the segment, it touches it‚Äôs index with it‚Äôs thumb. that is how it‚Äôs selected. The selected mesh is then selected as Mesh, The other sections get scaled and proportionally modified so they correspond with the relative position of the selected segment new scaling, and are displayed with default_material. only Mesh can be modified. 

üìÇ EXAMPLES:
(Pending: Add or record these into examples/ folder.)

examples/phase1_primitive_spawn.json: shows conversational primitive selection and resulting mesh at origin.

examples/phase1_segment_select.mp4: shows user pointing to segments with right index and confirming with thumb.

examples/flux_prompt_capture.txt: recorded output from user-agent chat used for PartPacker prompt.

‚ö† OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Primitive step is optional, but skipping it should still trigger prompt gathering.

Gesture tracking must be accurate‚Äîsegment selection depends on index/thumb contact precision.

Cull logic must filter out micro-meshes by bounding volume before segmentation.

Naming convention for mesh parts: seg_1, seg_2, seg_3, etc. (by descending volume).

Conversational agent must:

Ask: "Do you want to create a primitive or just describe what you have in mind?"

Extract sufficient detail to build a meaningful Flux prompt before passing to backend.

Backend must support toggles between:

fuse_mesh: Boolean union of all major segments

segment_selection: Gesture-driven picking of a single mesh for editing

All mesh transformations (e.g., centering, alignment) must maintain consistent scene coordinates.

Ensure debugging toggle exists for minimum mesh volume cull threshold.
