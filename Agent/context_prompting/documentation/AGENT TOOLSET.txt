CONJURE Agent Toolset

1. Introduction & Agent Output Structure

This document defines the complete set of tools available to the CONJURE conversational agent. These tools are the bridge between the agent's understanding and the CONJURE application's backend logic.

As specified in `masterPrompt.txt`, the agent's response for every turn must be a JSON object with a specific structure. The backend (`launcher/agent_api.py`) will parse this object to extract the spoken response, the user prompt for generation, and the instruction to execute.

**Agent Output JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "instruction": {
    "tool_name": "name_of_the_tool_to_call",
    "parameters": {
      "param1": "value1",
      "param2": "value2"
    }
  },
  "user_prompt": "An SDXL-optimized text prompt, constantly updated based on the conversation."
}
```
-   `instruction`: The structured command for the backend. If no command is needed for a specific conversational turn, this can be `null`.
-   `user_prompt`: The generative prompt for ComfyUI, which the agent refines throughout the conversation.

The `launcher` will execute the function associated with `tool_name`, passing the `parameters` object to it.

2. Toolset Definition

spawn_primitive [OPTIONAL]
- Description: Creates a new primitive mesh object in Blender, replacing existing mesh
- Parameters: primitive_type (string) INCLUDED PRIMITIVES: "Sphere", "Cube", "Cone", "Cylinder", "Disk", "Torus", "Head", "Body"

generate_flux_mesh
- Description: Triggers API generative pipeline that results in a mesh, that get’s imported
- Parameters: prompt (string, required. this is same as [“user_prompt”]), seed (integer, optional, default=1337), min_volume_threshold (float, optional, default=0.01)
[EITHER]
fuse_mesh [EITHER this or segment_selection]
- Description: Boolean union all mesh segments from largest to smallest into single 'Mesh' object
- Parameters: None (operates on current segments in scene)
[EITHER]
segment_selection
- Description: Enables gesture-based segment selection mode where user can point and select mesh segments
- Parameters: None (enters interactive selection mode)
 3.
select_concept
- Description: User chooses concept option, triggers multi-view rendering and mv2mv/mv23D workflows
- Parameters: option_id (integer) - 1, 2, or 3

Tool: `spawn_primitive`
-   **Description:** Creates a new primitive mesh object in the Blender scene, replacing any existing mesh. This is the starting point for a new creation.
-   **Parameters:**
    -   `primitive_type` (string): The type of primitive to spawn.
        -   *Allowed Values:* "Sphere", "Cube", "Cone", "Cylinder", "Disk", "Torus", "Head", "Body".

Tool: `generate_concepts`
-   **Description:** Initiates the first stage of the generative pipeline. This instructs Blender to render the current view from the `GestureCamera` and tells the `launcher` to execute the `promptMaker.json` workflow in ComfyUI using the current `user_prompt.txt`.
-   **Parameters:** None. (The agent is expected to have updated `user_prompt.txt` before calling this tool).
